# Time Series Foundation Model - Zero-Shot Evaluation

This repository contains the evaluation results of several foundation models for time series forecasting under a **zero-shot setting**.

The evaluation is based on the **GIFT Eval** and **Chronos** benchmarks, to assess the generalization capabilities of these models on **unseen time series data**.
